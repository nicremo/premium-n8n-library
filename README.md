# Premium n8n Library

Yeah, so while everyone else is out there selling their n8n workflows for $49.99 (plus tax, probably), I figured I'd just throw mine up here for free. Call me crazy.

## What's This?

This is my collection of n8n workflows. Just started building this out, so it's not massive yet—but it's growing.

Instead of gatekeeping automation, I'm sharing what I build. Use them, break them, improve them.

## Featured Workflows

**[Ghost Automated Blog System](workflows/automation/ghost-automated-blog-system.md)** - Fully automated content pipeline that scrapes news, picks SEO topics with AI, writes articles with Claude, generates cover images, and publishes to Ghost. Runs hands-free every morning. The image upload logic alone is worth checking out if you're working with Ghost's API.

## Structure

```
/workflows
  /automation      - General automation
  /ai              - AI/ML integrations
  /data-processing - Data manipulation
  /integrations    - Service connections
  /communication   - Messaging, email, notifications
  /productivity    - Productivity tools
/examples          - Well-documented learning examples
```

## How to Use

1. Grab the JSON file you want
2. Import it into your n8n instance
3. Configure your credentials
4. Read what it does before running it
5. You're done
