# Examples

This folder contains example workflows that are well-documented and meant for learning.

Unlike the main workflows folder where the focus is on functionality, these examples prioritize explanation and education.

## What Goes Here?

- Starter workflows for common use cases
- Well-commented examples demonstrating n8n concepts
- Template workflows that people can easily customize
- Tutorials in workflow form

## Format

Each example should include:
- A descriptive name
- Detailed notes/comments in the workflow
- A markdown file with the same name explaining what it does, why, and how to customize it

Example:
- `webhook-to-database.json` (the workflow)
- `webhook-to-database.md` (the explanation)

Keep it simple, keep it clear.
