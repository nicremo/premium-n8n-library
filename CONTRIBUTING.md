# Contributing

So you want to contribute? Cool. Here's the deal.

## What to Contribute

- New workflows that actually do something useful
- Fixes to existing workflows
- Documentation improvements
- Better organization ideas

## How to Contribute

1. Fork this repo
2. Add your stuff or make your changes
3. Make sure it actually works
4. Submit a pull request
5. I'll review it when I get to it

## Guidelines

**For Workflows:**
- Put it in the right category folder
- Name it something descriptive
- Add notes/comments explaining what it does
- Don't commit credentials or API keys (seriously, check your JSON)
- Test it before submitting

**For Documentation:**
- Keep the tone casual but informative
- No corporate speak
- If you're explaining something technical, explain it like you would to a friend

**For Code:**
- If you're adding scripts or tools, make sure they're documented
- Python? Add requirements.txt
- Node.js? Add package.json
- Whatever else? Add a readme

## What NOT to Contribute

- Workflows that require paid services without free tiers (unless clearly documented)
- Malicious workflows or anything sketchy
- Duplicate workflows that already exist (unless yours is significantly better)
- Broken stuff

## Review Process

I'll look at PRs when I can. If something needs changes, I'll let you know. If it's good to go, I'll merge it. Simple as that.

No formal review process, no committee, no corporate approval chain. Just humans helping humans automate stuff.

## Questions?

Open an issue. Or don't. Whatever works for you.
